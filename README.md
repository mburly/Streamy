# About

I started developing Streamy for my father who enjoys watching YouTube live streams. He's subscribed to many channels that live stream and sometimes has a hard time figuring out which channels are currently live. He also wants to watch the live streams from his television and isn't a fan of screencasting from his iPad because of latency issues.\

Streamy acts as in the form of a TV guide and TV remote by listing all added channels that are currently live. If a channel is selected, that channel's live stream is opened on the television connected to the machine. Streamy utilizes [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) and [Streamlink](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink) to open and stream the live video from the stream at the highest quality with the lowest latency. Channels are easily added by providing Streamy with a  channel URL i.e. youtube.com/@NASA. Streamy also provides the same support for Twitch streams, also added through the channel's URL.
